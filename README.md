Analyzed hotel booking data to identify key trends and cancellation patterns. Built an interactive Excel dashboard with visual insights on booking types, guest segments, seasonality, and cancellation rates to support data-driven decision making.

# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis
## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to understand the patterns and factors driving cancellations. Using Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Dashboarding), I transformed raw booking data into actionable insights.

The final deliverable is an interactive dashboard that highlights KPIs, trends, and guest behaviors, helping hotels make data-driven decisions to reduce cancellations and improve customer experience.

## Objectives

Analyze booking and guest data to uncover cancellation trends.

Create calculated fields (room_status, guest_type) for deeper insights.

Build an interactive Excel dashboard with KPIs and visualizations.

Provide actionable recommendations for hotel management.

## Tools & Skills

Microsoft Excel → Power Query, Pivot Tables, Conditional IF formulas, Dashboard design.

Data Analytics → Data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis.

Visualization → KPI cards, charts (bar, line, pie), cancellation insights.

## Key Steps

#### 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation

Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., contact details, agent, company).

Created new calculated fields:

room_status → Check if guest received the desired room.

guest_type → Categorized into Singles, Couples, Families.

#### 2. Pivot Table Analysis

Cancellations by hotel type (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel).

Guest types (Single, Couple, Family) and their cancellation trends.

Seasonal trends (monthly cancellations).

Room status impact on cancellations.

#### 3. Dashboard Creation

KPIs: Total Bookings, Total Cancellations, Cancellation Rate (37%).

Interactive visualizations for clear insights.

Summary insights box for quick decision-making.

## Dashboard Preview

Insights & Results

Cancellation Rate: ~37% of total bookings were canceled.

Hotel Type: City Hotels had a higher cancellation rate than Resort Hotels.

Guest Type: Families showed more cancellations compared to Singles and Couples.

Room Status: Guests not assigned their reserved room type were more likely to cancel.

Seasonality: Peak cancellations observed during the summer months.

## Impact

This analysis provides actionable recommendations for hotel management:

Improve room allocation accuracy to reduce dissatisfaction.

Offer targeted retention strategies for families.

Prepare for peak-season cancellations with better overbooking strategies.
